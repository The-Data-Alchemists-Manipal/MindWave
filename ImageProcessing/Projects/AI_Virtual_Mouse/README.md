# AI-BASED VIRTUAL MOUSE

It is basically used to perform all your actions with the help of your hand instead of using Mechanical Mouse.
It is achieved using various Python and OpenCV libraries like CVZONE, AUTOPY, and MediaPipe.

## How to run this?
1. Python of **version 3.8** only.
***If you have any other version of Python, make sure you use a virtual environment to upgrade or degrade the version of Python.***
2. Make sure that the cv zone, media pipe, and OpenCV are installed.
   ```python
   $pip install opencv-python
   $pip install mediapipe
   $pip install cvzone
   ```
3. Make sure you install autopy properly.
   ```python
   $pip install autopy
   ```
   ### AutoPy is compatible only with the version of 3.8 or lower, so make sure the version of Python is 3.8 or lower.
