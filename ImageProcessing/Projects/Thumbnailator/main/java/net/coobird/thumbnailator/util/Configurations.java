 * This enum lists properties that affect the behavior of Thumbnailator.

 * <h2>Implementation note</h2>
 * The values for properties listed here will be read from the system
 * properties via {@link System#getProperty(String)}, therefore, can be set
 * via the {@code -D} options when invoking the JVM.
 * Alternatively, they can be included in {@code thumbnailator.properties}
 * on the classpath (of the current thread's class loader.)
 *
 * <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
 * Properties listed here are not part of Thumbnailator's public API.
 * Therefore, code invoking Thumbnailator should not depend on these
 * workarounds always being present.

     * <p>
     * To fundamentally address the issue requires some dramatic design changes
     * to the core parts of Thumbnailator which would take some time and would
     * affect many internal parts of the library.
     * Such changes would take time before being implemented, a workaround has

     * {@code OutOfMemoryError}s.
     * <p>
     * The workaround is not enabled by default, as it can negatively affect
     * the quality of the final image. It has also not been extensively
     * tested and will not necessarily prevent {@code OutOfMemoryError}s.
     * <p>
     * When the workaround enabled, a smaller version of the source image will
     * be used to reduce memory usage, under the following conditions:
     * <ul>
     *   <li>Both height and width have dimensions larger than 1800 pixels</li>
     *   <li>The expected memory size of the source image will take up more
