# **Virtual Drag and Drop using Image Processing**

It is a basic drag and drop system built using image processing to ease the tasks. 
It is implemented using rectangle. It can further be extended to various different shapes and also in varying numbers.

Some of the requirements to be satisfied : 

1. Python of version 3.10 or greater
2. Some of the installations needed : 
   
   ```python
   pip install opencv-python
   pip install cvzone==1.4.1
   pip install mediapipe
   ```

Note : Make sure that version of cvzone is 1.4 only.
Issue you would face otherwise : HandDetector object won't be able to find attribute findPosition as it's deprecated in >1.4
