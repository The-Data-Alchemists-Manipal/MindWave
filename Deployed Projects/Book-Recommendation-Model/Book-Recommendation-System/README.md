**DESCRIPTION**

This project introduces a collaborative book recommendation system. By entering a book name, users can receive recommendations based on the preferences of other users who enjoyed similar books.

**STEPS**

1. Data Cleaning
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Data Modeling
4. Model Deployment with Falsk

**MODELS USED**

There are 4 main types of recommendation system:

1. Popularity based system
2. Collaborative Filtering
3. Content-Based Filtering
4. Hybrid Recommendation Systems

I have used popularity based and collaborative filtering methods for this model. Collaborative filtering is done using cosine similarity.

**LIBRARIES NEEDED**

The project utilizes the following libraries:

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Flask

**CONCLUSION**  

During the last few decades, with the rise of YouTube, Amazon, Netflix, and many other such web services, recommender systems have taken more and more place in our lives. From e-commerce (suggest to buyers articles that could interest them) to online advertisement (suggest to users the right contents, matching their preferences), recommender systems are today unavoidable in our daily online journeys. In this project, I have tried to build a book recommendation system for the user based on collaborative filtering.
