In this project , we have collected a Dataset on Water Quality


Tasks to be performed : -
1. Data Collection and Cleaning
2. Data Visualization
3. Finding Correlation
4. Data Pre-Processing 
5. Train & Test Split
6. Model Training and Evaluation
7. Building a Predictive System

The Model Predicts the quality of water on the basis of ' Dissolved Oxygen (mg/L)' 
If this quantity is above 8.0 (water is good for aquatic lives and even day-to-day activities)
if the quality is less than 8.0 (water is of poor quality and higher possibility of being polluted)
