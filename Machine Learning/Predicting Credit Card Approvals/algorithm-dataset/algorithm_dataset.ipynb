In the case of predicting credit card applications, it is important to see if our machine learning model is equally capable of predicting approved and denied status, in line with the frequency of these labels in our original dataset. If our model is not performing well in this aspect, then it might end up approving the application that should have been approved. The confusion matrix helps us to view our model's performance from these aspects.  </p>"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":326,"id":"ccaab1c4-94e2-4b9a-a9be-a74b6a813cd0","metadata":{"dc":{"key":"66"},"tags":["sample_code"],"trusted":true},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Accuracy of logistic regression classifier:  1.0\n"]},{"data":{"text/plain":["array([[103,   0],\n","       [  0, 125]])"]},"execution_count":326,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["# Import confusion_matrix\n","# ...
