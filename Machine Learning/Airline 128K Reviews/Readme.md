In this project , we have performed extensive EDA on 128K Airline Reviews Dataset

Dataset-https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joelljungstrom/128k-airline-reviews

[Note - The Dataset is >25MB , therfore , the link for the dataset is uploaded above)

The main focus of this project was to understand the relation between customers' overall experience with Airlines 
and what all parameters in the dataset correlate to most other parameters 

As a result, we see that particular parameters relation with the Review column of the Dataset
To accomplish this, A Logistic Regression model was trained for these specifications.



Tasks Performed :-

1.Data Collection

2.Data Preprocessing ( checking for null , duplicate values and etc.)

3.Data Cleaning 

4.EDA & Data Visualization

5.Text Vectorization

6.WordCloud formation

7.Logistic Regression Model Building(Training the Data[TfidfVectorization for the Review Columns])

8.Checking the Model on parameters like- accuracy, precision,f1 and etc.
