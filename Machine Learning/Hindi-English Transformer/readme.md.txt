Description:
The Hindi-English Corpora dataset is designed for machine translation from the Hindi language to English. It contains a collection of parallel sentences in Hindi and their corresponding English translations. This dataset can be utilized to train and evaluate machine translation models specifically tailored for Hindi-English translation tasks. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and created by Aiswarya Ramachandran.

Dataset Details:

Size: The dataset comprises a total of [insert number of examples] sentence pairs.
Format: The dataset is provided in a CSV file format.
Data Fields:
The dataset consists of the following columns in the CSV file:

source: Contains the Hindi sentences.

target: Contains the corresponding English translations.

Potential Use Cases:

Machine Translation: This dataset can be used to develop machine translation models that translate Hindi sentences to English.
Natural Language Processing (NLP): The dataset can be utilized for various NLP tasks such as language generation, sentiment analysis, or information retrieval.
Data Quality and Preprocessing:

Quality: The dataset has been curated with a focus on parallel sentence pairs to ensure accurate translations.
Preprocessing: Basic preprocessing steps, such as removing special characters or normalizing text, may be required before training machine translation models.
Dataset License:
The dataset is subject to the terms and conditions specified by the dataset creator. Please refer to the Kaggle dataset page (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aiswaryaramachandran/hindienglish-corpora) for the specific license and usage information.

Working : It is uses transformer architecture coded with reference from Tensor flow Transformer.Also this is a vanilla transformer. Also hugging face is used to provide us with provide us with a state of the art pre built models ready to use as well as train with very little code.
