# TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION

### Titanic Survival Prediction Using Machine Learning & Python

### OBJECTIVE:
The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous wrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the RMS Titanic, widely considered “unsinkable”, sank after hitting an iceberg. 

The competition task was to use machine learning to create a model that predicts “What types of people were more likely to survive?” used passenger data (i.e. name, age, sex, socio-economic class, etc.).

### Workflow stages:

The competition solution workflow goes through seven stages,
1. Question or problem definition
2. Wrangle, prepare, cleanse the data
3. Exploratory Data Analysis
4. Acquire training and testing data
5. Model, predict and solve the problem

_In this, The highest model accuracy for the testing data is achieved with the Random Forest & Gradient boosting classifier model, it also predicted the survival numbers for the testing set with a score of 84.26%._
