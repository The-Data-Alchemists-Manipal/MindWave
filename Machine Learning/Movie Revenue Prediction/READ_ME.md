Movie Box Office Prediction Model

Description:
I used linear regression to model the relationship between the production budget and revenue, and visualise the data through scatter plots, regression lines, and residual plots.In this project, data cleaning techniques such as handling missing values, removing duplicates, and filtering out empty or irrelevant data was applied.  The goal is to understand the impact of production budget on revenue and evaluate the accuracy of the regression model.

Models Used:
1.Linear Regression: to establish a linear relationship between the production budget and its worldwide gross revenue.
2.Residual Analysis: residuals  from the linear regression was analyzed to assess the quality of the model.
3.Influence Analysis: Cook's distance was calculated to identify influential data points.

Libraries Used:
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scikit-learn
Statsmodels

Accuracy Measures:
r2 score: 0.5480572766399463
