## Introduction

We'll be doing a Linear Regression for the California Dataset available at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/california-housing-prices).

## Loading and cleaning data

We first load the dataset:

```{r california, comment=NA}
california <- read.csv("housing.csv")
names(california)
dim(california)
summary(california)
```

We note that the dataset contains `207` missing values. As this is an insignificant amount of data with respect to the whole set, we may omit those observations.

```{r naomit, comment=NA}
california <- na.omit(california)
california$ocean_proximity <- as.factor(california$ocean_proximity)
```

We also briefly view the contents of the dataset:

```{r head, comment=NA}
head(california)
```

## Building Linear Model

Our variable of interest is the `median_house_value` variable, which contains the median of house values based on various factors.

Now we check for any multicollinearity in the dataset:

```{r pairs, comment=NA}
pairs(california[, c(-9, -10)],
      pch = 16,
      col = rgb(120, 120, 120, maxColorValue = 255, alpha = 150))
```

This helps us to decrease the number of covariates in our linear regression model, which further results in drastically reducing the time complexity of our program. We note that `latitude` and `longitude` are highly collinear with each other, so it is redundant to keep both of them in our model. Further, we note that the `total_rooms`, `total_bedrooms`, `population` and `households` are almost perfectly multicollinear. Hence, we keep any one of them, and drop the other three. For simplicity, we choose `latitude` and `population` from the above and continue our model.

Thus, our linear regression model now looks like the following: $$y = \beta_0+\beta_1x_1+\beta_2x_2+\beta_3x_3+\beta_4x_4+\beta_5x_5$$ where:

-   $\beta_0$ is the average value of the house when all the other covariates are `0`
-   $\beta_1$ is the coefficient corresponding to `latitude`
-   $\beta_2$ is the coefficient corresponding to `housing_median_age`
-   $\beta_3$ is the coefficient corresponding to `population`
-   $\beta_4$ is the coefficient corresponding to `median_income`
-   $\beta_5$ is the coefficient corresponding to the factor variable `ocean_proximity`

The function for the linear model in `R` is `lm`. We use this to build our model for the linear regression. However, before doing that, we would like to break our data into training and test sets. We would do a random sampling, after setting a fixed seed for reproducibility and the ratio for train to test is 80:20.

```{r sets, comment=NA}
set.seed(2023)
x <- sample(1:nrow(california),
            0.8 * nrow(california))
train <- california[x,]
test <- california[-x,]
```

We now proceed to build the model with the training set:

```{r linmodel, comment=NA}
model <- lm(median_house_value ~ latitude + housing_median_age + population + median_income + ocean_proximity,
            data = train)
summary(model)
```

## Prediction

We will predict with the help of our model and compare it with the original test data that we have kept aside. The `predict` function in `R` is used to predict values with the help of a fitted model:

```{r prediction, comment=NA}
pred <- predict(model,
                newdata = data.frame(latitude=test$latitude,
                                     housing_median_age=test$housing_median_age,
                                     population=test$population,
                                     median_income=test$median_income,
                                     ocean_proximity=test$ocean_proximity)
)
head(pred)
```

That ends the discussion for Linear regression on the California Dataset.
