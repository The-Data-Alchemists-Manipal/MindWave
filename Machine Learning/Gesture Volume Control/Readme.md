This code will use the MediaPipe hand detection model to track the user's hand gestures. The distance between the thumb and index finger will be used to control the volume level. The code will also display the frame from the webcam so that the user can see the hand gestures that they are making.

To run the code, you will need to install the following libraries:

    OpenCV
    MediaPipe
    NumPy
    pycaw

Once you have installed the libraries, you can run the code by saving it as a Python file and then running it from the command line. For example, if you saved the code as gesture_volume_control.py, you could run it by typing the following command into the command line:
Code snippet :

python gesture_volume_control.py

or directly run the program.
