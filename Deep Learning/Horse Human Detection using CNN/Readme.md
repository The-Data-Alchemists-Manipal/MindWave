# Horse-Human Detection
Horse-human detection is a computer vision task that involves classifying images to distinguish between those containing horses and those containing humans. This can be achieved using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which are deep learning models specifically designed for image analysis.

## CNN Model Architecture
The CNN model used for horse-human detection typically consists of multiple layers, each performing specific operations on the input images. Here is a breakdown of the model structure:

**Convolutional Layers**: The first few layers in the model are convolutional layers. These layers extract features from the input images by applying convolution operations with learnable filters. The filters scan the images to capture different visual patterns such as edges, textures, and shapes. In the provided code snippet, there are five convolutional layers with increasing filter size (16, 32, 64, 64, 64) and a kernel size of (3, 3). The ReLU activation function is used to introduce non-linearity to the output of each convolutional layer.

**MaxPooling Layers**: After each convolutional layer, a max pooling layer is added. Max pooling helps reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature maps while retaining the most important information. In this model, max pooling is performed with a pool size of (2, 2), which downsamples the feature maps by keeping the maximum value in each 2x2 region.

**Flatten Layer**: The output from the convolutional layers is flattened into a one-dimensional vector. This flattening operation converts the multi-dimensional feature maps into a format that can be fed into the subsequent fully connected layers.

**Dense Layers**: After the flattening layer, one or more fully connected (dense) layers are added. These layers take the flattened vector as input and perform computations to learn complex patterns and relationships. In the provided code snippet, there is a dense layer with 512 units and a ReLU activation function. This layer helps in capturing higher-level representations.

**Output Layer**: The final dense layer has a single unit with a sigmoid activation function. This unit produces a probability score between 0 and 1, indicating the likelihood of the input image belonging to a specific class. A threshold of 0.5 is commonly used to classify the image as either a horse or a human based on this probability score.

## Usage Instructions
To create a trained model for horse-human detection, you can follow these steps:

1. Create and train a CNN model using a labeled dataset of horse and human images. The provided code snippet assumes that you have already trained the model.

2. Save the trained model's weights to a file, such as model_weights.h5, using the appropriate method provided by your deep learning framework.

3. Install the necessary dependencies, including TensorFlow and Streamlit.

4. Create a Streamlit web app (streamlit_app.py), as shown in the provided code snippet, to allow users to upload images and perform horse-human detection using the trained model.

5. Run the Streamlit web app using the command streamlit run streamlit_app.py. The app will start, and you can access it in your browser.

6. Upload an image through the app interface, and the model will classify it as either a horse or a human based on the trained weights.

7. Make sure to customize and adapt the code snippets according to your specific requirements and dataset.
