# face-detedtion-MTCNN

## What is MTCNN?
MTCNN (Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Networks) is a popular face detection algorithm used in computer vision tasks. It is specifically designed for real-time face detection in images and videos. MTCNN consists of three stages.
No dataset is required.

## What is in this project?
In this project, I have:
- compared the superiority of the MTCNN algorithm over opencv in the face detection task.
- keypoints detection using MTCNN.
- extract faces in the image.
