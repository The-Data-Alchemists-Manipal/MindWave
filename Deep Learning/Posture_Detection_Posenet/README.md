# Deep Learning Model Posture Detection with PoseNet

This repository contains a web application that utilizes the PoseNet model for pose estimation. The application captures video from the user's webcam and detects human poses in real-time.

## Model Description

The PoseNet model is a deep learning model developed by Google that allows for real-time pose estimation using machine learning techniques. It can identify key body joints and provide their positions in an image or video. This implementation uses the ml5.js library, which provides a simple interface for working with PoseNet in JavaScript.

## Features

- Real-time pose estimation using the user's webcam
- Drawing of key points and skeleton lines on the video feed
- Image overlay on specific body parts

## Dependencies

The following dependencies are used in this project:

- [ml5.js](https://ml5js.org/): A friendly JavaScript library for machine learning
- [p5.js](https://p5js.org/): A JavaScript library for creative coding.

## Tech Stack

The following technologies and libraries were used in this project:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- [ml5.js](https://ml5js.org/): A friendly JavaScript library for machine learning
- [p5.js](https://p5js.org/): A JavaScript library for creative coding

The project utilizes HTML for structuring the web page, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity and integration with PoseNet. The ml5.js library is used to load the PoseNet model and perform pose estimation, while p5.js is used for drawing the video feed and overlays on the canvas.
